  #### Getting Started
  If you're new to running a web application built with  ASP .Net framework
  [ASP .Net Getting Started](http://www.asp.net/get-started)
  will help walk you through learn about ASP .Net and [Getting Started with
  IIS](http://www.iis.net/learn/get-started/getting-started-with-iis) has
  great details about IIS and its parameters.

  #### Logging in via Remote Desktop
  The Administrator password is included in the passwords/secrets section
  of this deployment. Use that password and the instructions found
  [here](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-to-your-server-via-rdp-windows)
  to login and begin managing IIS.

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This setup was built using a [Powershell
  Script](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/dd742419.aspx).
  Once the deployment is up, the script will not be run again, so it is
  safe to change settings and configurations on your server and within
  IIS. The FTP (File transfer Protocol) credential is included in the
  passwords/secrets section of this deployment.
